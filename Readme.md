## Analysis of the pharmaceuticals data with pandas and matplotlib
### Observations and Insights
The tumor volume for the mice seem to decrease only for drug regimens Capomulin and Ramicane. For the rest of the drug regimens, the tumor volume increases with the timepoints. The number of mice treated with Capomulin and Ramicane drugs were more than any others. The Standard Deviation calculated for the various drugs shows that tumor volume data for Capomulin and Ramicane drugs are smaller which implies the data is distributed over a smaller ranges than other drug types.

The number of female and male mice used for the study was almost the same. There is no significant difference in tumor volume changes across the gender of the mice.

The correlation coefficient of weight and tumor volumes of the mice in Capomulin group is 0.84 which is closer to 1, which implies as the weight of the weight of the mouse increases the average tumor volume also increases in most cases.

The age of the mice does not have any relation with tumor volume changes
